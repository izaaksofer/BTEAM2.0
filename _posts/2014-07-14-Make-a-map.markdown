It's monday, and as every monday, a new challenge is waiting for us! This time came to visit us Mike Bostock a really expert of data visualization, who has worked, amongst others, for New York Times.
As usual the bar gets higher! We have time until this Friday afternoon for creating an interactive world map, showing the price of cocaine per country.

By showing us the demo Mike made, we discover many business opportunity. For sure, one of the most interesting came from the arbitrage opportunity between Colombia and Canada. Buying a kilo for 200$ and sell it for 20.000$ sounded a great deal for most of us!
